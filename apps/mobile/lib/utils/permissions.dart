/// Permission helpers for household member-level authorization.
///
/// Every action helper takes a `Map<String, dynamic>?` membership row
/// (matching the codebase's universal pattern — there's no Membership
/// type) and returns a bool. Null or missing-field membership returns
/// false (deny by default).
///
/// Action helpers internally combine:
///   - kind != 'sub_profile' (defense in depth — kids never pass even
///     if their row had an unexpected role)
///   - role in ('owner', 'admin')
///
/// All action helpers are equivalent today (they all return isAdmin).
/// The named helpers exist to document intent at call sites and to
/// future-proof against per-action permission changes — e.g., if
/// "edit household" later requires owner-only, we change one line here
/// instead of grepping the app.
///
/// Counterpart RLS / RPC enforcement lives in migrations 0017 and 0018.
